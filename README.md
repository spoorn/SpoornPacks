# SpoornPacks
SpoornPacks is an API Library mod for the Minecraft Fabric mod loader that adds simple-to-use APIs for automagically generating resource asset and data files, and injects them into the game as a mock Resource Pack. This allows mod creators to create their resources entirely in code with very succinct APIs, while still allowing overriding via your own Resource files.

The goal of this mod is to simplify resource creation (i.e. blocks, items, structures, features, etc.) as much as possible for the majority of use cases, while being extensible to more complex ones.
